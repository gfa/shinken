Here is a way to setup a shinken in "raw mode" without installing it really:

Install
-------
After unpacking the tarball move the shinken directory to the desired destination
and give it to the shinken user::

	mv shinken /usr/local
	chown -R shinken:shinken /usr/local/shinken

Update / Remove
---------------
Just remove your shinken directory
	rm -rf /usr/local/shinken

Running
-------
It's easy, there is already a launch script for you::

  shinken/bin/launch_all_debug.sh

It will generate some /tmp/*debug files that you can use to debug the code :)
